# Unit-4-Game
Dynamic Crystal Guessing Game

# Object
The user is presented with four crystals when the game loads. Each of these crystals has a numerical value that can only be discovered by clicking on each and watching the value of the counter increase. There is a total value per round that the user needs to achieve exactly in order to win the game. 

If the user exceeds the value of the goal, they lose the game and the next round begins. Should the user match the exact score, they will win the game and the next round begins. Both the losses and wins are shown while the user remains on the page.

Each time a new round begins, a new goal value will be generated for the user to pursue. New crystal values for each of the crystals will also be generated when new rounds begin.
